        <h1>About japanese</h1>
        <p>Japanese culture is a set of values that puts importance on social harmony and hard work. Up until the 10th century, Japanese culture was similar to the Chinese culture, but the rise of the samurai in the Heian Period and the isolation during the Edo Period changed the rules of society. Overall, the culture was influenced by the local Shinto religion, Buddhism, Confucianism and the limited natural resources.</p>

            <h2>Etiquette</h2>
            <p>It can be very challenging to learn Japanese beyond the conversational basics. As is the case with other areas of Japanese society, there are strict codes governing language and its use, and even native Japanese speakers find it complex and difficult to master. And that’s before you’ve mastered writing pictograms — Japanese ‘letters’. While the Japanese are forgiving of language mistakes made by foreigners.</p>

            <h2>Attitudes to expats</h2>
            <p>Most people who travel to Japan have very positive experiences of Japanese people, finding them warm, friendly, honest, polite, generous and helpful. What do the Japanese really think of Westerners? One writer says the Japanese think that they’re the only people who take their shoes off before entering a room and that all Westerners are white .</p>

            <h2>Religion</h2>
            <p>Religion does not play a big role in the everyday life of most Japanese people today, especially in the big cities where religious activities and rituals are not common. Many people only engage in religious activities at ceremonies such as births, weddings and funerals. Some may visit a shrine or temple on New Year and participate in local festivals (matsuri).</p>

                While Japanese lifestyle has been Westernized recently, Japanese people still do everything possible to preserve their rich cultural heritage by practicing tea ceremony, wearing kimono and studying traditional arts and crafts from early childhood.</marquee>
